ðŸ”¹ User Interface â€“ Built with Gradio for an interactive experience
ðŸ”¹ Download Feature â€“ Exports the meal plan as a CSV file

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack
âœ… Python â€“ Core logic and data processing
âœ… Pandas â€“ Data manipulation & filtering
âœ… Gradio â€“ User-friendly web interface
âœ… Machine Learning (Anomaly Detection) â€“ Potential future integration for smarter meal recommendations

ðŸ“Œ Why This Project?
Maintaining a proper diet is key to achieving fitness goals, but meal planning can be overwhelming. This project automates meal selection while ensuring a nutritionally balanced approach, making healthy eating easier and more accessible.
